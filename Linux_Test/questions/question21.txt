Question 21: (Containers manage)
========================
Configure a container to start automatically
- create a container named mycontainer using the image which you build previously
- configure the service to automatically mount the directory “/opt/file” to container directory
“/opt/incoming” and user directory “/opt/processed” to container directory “/opt/output”
- configure to run it as a systemd service that should run from existing user xanadu only
- the service should be named mycontainer and should automatically start at system rebot
without any manual intervention.
