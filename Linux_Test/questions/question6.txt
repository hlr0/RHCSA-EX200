Question 6: (SELINUX)
========================
Configure a basic web server that displays “Welcome to the Jungle” once connected and
make it listen on port 82

SELINUX – make sure selinux is in enforcing mode
SELINUX BOOLEAN – ensure the httpd is able to access the user home directory
SELINUX PORT – the system is not able to connect to httpd service port 82 it should be
accessible at port 82 and should start at boot time
SELINUX CONTEXT – Ensure that the httpd service is able to access and host files from
the /test directory – not from /var/www/html
