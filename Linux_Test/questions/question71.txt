Question:

Resize the logical volume vo and its filesystem to 290 MB. Make sure that the filesystem contents remain intact.

Note: Partitions are seldom exactly the same size requested, so a size within the range of 260 MB to 320 MiB is acceptable.



Answer:


df -hT

lvextend -L +100M /dev/vg0/vo

lvscan

xfs_growfs /home/ // home is LVM mounted directory

Note: This step is only need to do in our practice environment, you do not need to do in the real exam

resize2fs /dev/vg0/vo // Use this comand to update in the real exam df -hT

OR

e2fsck -f/dev/vg0/vo

umount /home

resize2fs /dev/vg0/vo required partition capacity such as 100M lvreduce -l 100M /dev/vg0/vo mount /dev/vg0/vo /home

df â€“Ht
