Question 11: (NFS - AUTOFS)
========================
Configure autofs to automount the home directories of netuserX user. Note the following:
- if you do not have a seperate server you can use your own localhost for this
- netuserX home directory is exported via NFS which is available on “192.168.0.91”
- (192.168.0.91) and your NFS-exports directory is “/netdir” for “netuserX”,
- netuserX home directory is “192.168.0.91:/home/guests/netuserX”
- netuserX home directory should be automounted autofs service
- home directories must be writable by there users
- password for “netuser” is “ablerate”
