Question 13: (file permissions)
========================
Copy the file /etc/fstab/ to /var/tmp. Configure the permissions of /var/tmp/fstab so that
- the file /var/tmp/fstab is owned by the root user
- the file /var/tmp/fstab belongs to the group root
- the file /var/tmp/fstab should not be executable by anyone
- the user “natasha” is able to read and write /var/tmp/fstab
- the user “harry” can neither write nore read /var/tmp/fstab
- all other users (current or future) have the ability to read /var/tmp/fstab
